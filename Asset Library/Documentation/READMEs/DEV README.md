## Getting Started

All the documentation is split by project/domain, so you can read about each section without getting too mixed up with the other parts of the application. 

- `PROJECT LIFECYCLE README.md` \
   This should be reviewed at the start of the project so the project team can agree on what's defined inside. 
- `SOLUTION README.md` \
   How the solution as a whole is designed along with explinations for things that aren't specific to any one project. 
- `API README.md`
