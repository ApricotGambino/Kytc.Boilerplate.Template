## Getting Started
//TODO: Explain code coverage



//TODO: Describe the project here

Functional Testing:

Yes, we are testing the product or software as a whole functionally whether it is functionally working properly or not (testing buttons, links etc.)

For example: Login page.

you provide the username and password, you test whether it is taking you to home page or not.

Integration Testing:

Yes, you test the integrated software only but you test where the data flow is happening and is there any changes happening in the database.

For example: Sending e-mail

You send one mail to someone, there is a data flow and also change in database (the sent table increases value by 1)

Remember - clicking links and images is not integration testing. Hope you understood why, because there is no change in database by just clicking on a link.

Hope this helped you.
