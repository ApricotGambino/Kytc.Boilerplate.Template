# Concept Overview

The *why's that?* part of the documentation.

---

Here you're going to find *concepts* about the way this project is written. These tend to be higher level ideas instead of actual implmentations,

There's a companion section to guides called [Guides](~/articles/guides/overview.md) 
that goes into applying concepts.

> [!TIP] 
> You may also want to investigate the `/src/tests/Sandbox` project for even more coding examples.
