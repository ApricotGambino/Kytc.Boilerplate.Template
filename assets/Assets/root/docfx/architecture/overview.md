# Architecture Overview

Why write code when you can read about it?

---

Here you're going to find ideas about how the solution is architected.  The documentation here is written to be presented to a technical audience.

>Example:
>
>If you've read the [Type Tables eature article](../features/type-tables.md) and want to know how they work in the project, check out the [Technical Type Table Article](articles/type-table.md), or [How To Add A Type In The Type Tables](guides/how-to-add-a-type-in-the-type-tables.md).  These articles will link to other relevant articles.

You can also find the generated code documentation [here](xref:Api). <!-- markdownlint-disable-line MD061 -->

> [!TIP]
> You may also want to investigate the `/src/tests/Sandbox` project for even more coding examples.
