<!--# Assets

## What is this?

This is a project that stores all assets that are used for the solution as a whole. This includes documentation, images, etc.

## Why is this a web project?

Because Visual Studio still doesn't have a solution for 'real' folders

in the solution view, we have to cheat by creating a web project to store all our assets in. This project doesn't build, and should never build.

Until they correct this, we'll keep doing it this way. Adding files to the filesystem instead of through the solution requires you to unload and reload a project to see the changes, unless it's specifically a web project.  This is true for 'Shared Projects' as well.
