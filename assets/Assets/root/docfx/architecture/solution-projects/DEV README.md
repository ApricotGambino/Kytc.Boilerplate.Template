<!--# Developer Documentation

This is the starting point for development documentation.  This project was originally built using the Boilerplate Template.

  //TODO: Add ToC
</details>

## Getting Started

All the documentation is split by project/domain, so you can read about each section without getting too mixed up with the other parts of the application.

### Scattered Documentation

- `//TODO`
- `//NOTE`
- `Method Summary Comments`
    - These can be easily generated by typing `///` above a method, Visual Studio will auto-fill most of the rest.

:warning:Keep your `//TODO` and `//NOTE` consistent. `ctrl+f` for `//TODO` won't find `//TO DO`   :warning:

### Structured Documentation

- `PROJECT LIFECYCLE README.md` \
   This should be reviewed at the start of the project so the project team can agree on what's defined inside.
- `SOLUTION README.md` \
   How the solution as a whole is designed along with explinations for things that aren't specific to any one project.
- `API README.md`

## Code Formatting

You should use tooling to ensure your code is properly formatted prior to check-in.

- C#
For C#,

//TODO: How to structure this, there's a reference in

- :file_folder: `visual-studio-configurations/`:  Here you're going to find those files that are used to configure Visual Studio.
  - :scroll: `.vsconfig`: This is a file that automatically suggests components and extensions. [Microsoft's 'documentation'](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/import-export-installation-configurations?view=vs-2022) \
    :warning: `Just incase your IDE doesn't prompt you to install these extensions, just go here to see what's suggested.` :warning:
  - :scroll: `.editorconfig`: This is a file that helps enforce code styles. using [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.CodeCleanupOnSave) which is in the .vsconfig file, C# code will be enforced on save.
