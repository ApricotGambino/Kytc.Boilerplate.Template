# ADR 002: No Changelog - 08/18/2025

## Context

Changelogs are great, but maintaining them automatically can be very difficult, and maintaining them manually can be very time consuming or error prone.

## Decision

At this time, this project will not use changelogs. If that changes, we need to version and update this ADR, ironically using a changelog section in this ADR.

## Consequences

### :heavy_check_mark:Pros

- We don't have to maintain a changelog
- If changes need to be tracked, a developer needs to consume the check-in information which provide ALL possible details.

### :heavy_multiplication_x:Cons

- No at-a-glance set of changes
